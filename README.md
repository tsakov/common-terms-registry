Common Terms Registry
===

The purpose of the Common Terms Registry is to encourage and enable all stakeholders to use the same terms when describing the same things (the same concept and value range) with regard to user need and preference sets in the User Preference server. The purpose, format (and maintenance?) of the Common Terms Registry will be defined in more detail by ISO 24751 REVISION (now underway). 

### How to Use

To start the registry

	[NODE_ENV={environment}] node ./start.js

To browse the registry

	Visit localhost:{port}/term/{name}
	
- The default port is 8082.
